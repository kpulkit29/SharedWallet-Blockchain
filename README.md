SharedWallet-Blockchain

Made using ethereum blockchain in private network

Shared wallet is a smart contract built on ethereum blockchain using truffle.Ether can be added to the wallet by any address holder and then that address along with the wallet owner address is included in the wallet list of addresses.The contract has a send_money function through which ether can be transferred to other addresses from the wallet.In case the sender is not the owner then he would send a proposal giving a reason which in turn would be approved by the owner for the transaction to take place(which is why it is a shared wallet).
